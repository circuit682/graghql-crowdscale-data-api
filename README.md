# CrowdsaleToken Data Visualization

This is a simple project that focuses on rendering data about the CrowdsaleToken after running a query on the back-end using GraphQL to the front-end through a basic React application. This project helped me learn about GraphQL and its importance in the web3 space.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that the following prerequisites are installed:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building applications.
- **npm**: The Node package manager for managing dependencies.
- **create-react-app**: A tool for setting up a modern web app by running one command.
- **Apollo Client**: A powerful tool for managing GraphQL data in your React applications.

## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/circuit682/graghql-crowdscale-data-api.git

2. Navigate to the project directories to Install the required dependencies for the backend and front-end::
```sh

cd el-hospital
npm install

cd el-hospital-frontend
npm install
```
## Running the Application
## To run the application, follow these steps:
1. Start the development server:
```sh
cd el-hospital-frontend
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can view various metrics related to the CrowdsaleToken, including:

Recent Minted Tokens
Recent Transfers
Token Upgrades
Each section provides insights into the token transactions, helping users understand the dynamics of the CrowdsaleToken ecosystem.

## Learnings
Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience with:

GraphQL: Understanding how to query and manage data efficiently.
React: Developing interactive user interfaces and managing application state.
Apollo Client: Integrating GraphQL into React applications for seamless data management.
## Future Improvements
Some potential improvements for the project include:

Enhancing the UI with more interactive elements and visualizations.
Implementing user authentication to provide personalized data views.
Adding more metrics to track token performance over time.
